Model Visualization Repository


Overview


This repository showcases advanced statistical and machine learning models using the Wage dataset from the ISLR package. The goal is to demonstrate the application of complex modeling techniques to real-world problems.


Models Implemented


1. Multiple Non-Linear Polynomial Model with Interactions
2. Multiple Non-Linear Generalized Additive Model (GAM) with Interactions
3. Multiple Logistic Regression Model
4. Multinomial Logistic Regression with Interaction using Neural Net
5. Multiple Linear Mixed Effects Models with Interactions
6. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with Mixed Effects
7. Kaplan-Meier Survival Model
8. Exponential Parametric Models
9. Cox Proportional Hazard Model
